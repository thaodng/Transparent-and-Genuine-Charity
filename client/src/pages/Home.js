        Many fake charity organizations pose as genuine and loot money from innocent people in the name of charity. Most people want to donate money to a good cause of charity, but they are unsure if the money is going to reach the right hands of the destitute. The blockchain system can bring transparency to online charity trusts. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if itâ€™s reaching the deserving hands or not.
